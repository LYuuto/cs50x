#### Description:
    A generic netcafe website with limiting booking funtion.

## Idea
At first, I thought of writing a generic booking website which would allow user to book whatever or what day they want. But again it doesn't really indicate what the client is booking for. So, it remained as a base idea. I tried to write a mobile application instead of a website but my laptop was too old generation and I couldn't install lastest application required and stuffs so I gave up and stick again with the base idea.

## Style and Designing
It was hard at first because I did not know there were a major mass of applications I can try to pre-design the website and make a prototype out of it. I started to try Figma because I was recommended. I took quite a liking to it because I'm used to draw and photoshop a lot. That's when I learnt about UI/UX designing and become quite interested in it.

Now back to the project, at first my idea was to do a generic booking website that only do booking function, not even indicating what the client is booking for so I was going for a space-like theme. But while I was chilling on social medias, I got an idea that netcafe would fit the booking function I was going for. So, to fit with the netcafe theme, I designed a cozy comfortable theme with slight brown like coffee color. Then again, I dun really want to do a place that already exists somewhere so I just make the netcafe located in very cold place so I can sevice the people with hot coffees and food.

Most of the sections in the webpage are pretty simple using only the box, text and pictures. I really wanted to try some transitions. That's why I added the 'about us' section but it didn't go well with the net cafe theme. But well I still added it. I didn't know a lot of css documentations. I searched and learnt a lot. Some of the solutions were easier than what I was trying to do and they surprised me.

It was really difficult to maintain designs and layout with different devices' widths and heights. Reading lots of documentations and learning from all kind of videos, I tried to do my best to make the website layout to look best in different devices within my capabilities.

# Booking
It was the base idea of my whole project. At start, I was thinking what kind of stuffs you can book at the netcafe like gaming rooms, conference room, etc.

I thought it would be too basic if I just allow booking any date so I limit it to within a week. It was pointless to book today or past days too. And then I added sessions so I can try limiting the sessions that is already taken to be unavailable. It was quite hard because I didn't know enough documentation to do so. I was suggested to use Ajax to add that function but I was quite lazy and procastinator so I just stick with the basic stuffs I know and tried to force to make it work. Somehow it worked but the user experience wise, it was quite bad. Well, as the first fully functional website, I don't wanna aim something too advanced so I won't procastinate thinking I have a lot to learn to do the final project.

# Thank you
Somehow I managed to finished my final project after so long procastinations and a lot of difficulties. It was quite hard to find a good free courses on the internet. It was quite hard with inflations in my country so I couldn't afford one just to follow my passion. Thank you to CS50 team for such an amazing course.
